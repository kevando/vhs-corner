  "The need for people to gather and exchange their stories, 
  to talk about the things that feel universal,  see that 
  others share similar experiences. This need to gather 
  around a campfire and discuss the things that tell each 
  one of us that we are not alone in the world. This 
  will never change." -a girl on Youtube
